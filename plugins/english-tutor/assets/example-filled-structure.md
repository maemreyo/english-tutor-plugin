> [!info] Structural Analysis
> **Structure Type:** Pattern
> 
> **Formula / Pattern:**
> ```text
> The + [Comparative Adj/Adv] + [S1] + [V1], the + [Comparative Adj/Adv] + [S2] + [V2]
> ```
> 
> **Components:**
> - **The**: Definite article used as an adverb here.
> - **Comparative**: Adjective or adverb in comparative form (e.g., more, better, faster, harder).
> - **S + V**: Subject and Verb clauses.
>
> **Formation Rules:**
> 1. Use comma to separate the two clauses.
> 2. If "be" is the verb, it can sometimes be omitted in informal contexts (e.g., "The sooner, the better").

> 
> **Functional Meaning:**
> - **Purpose:** To express correlation or proportional change.
> - **Nuance:** Can be used for advice, warnings, or general observations.
>

> 
> **1. Pattern Error**

> - **Why:** Missing the second "the". Both clauses must start with "the".
>

> - ❌ **Mistake:** The more I eat, the fatter I am getting. (Grammatically okay but "the fatter I get" is more parallel)
> - ✅ **Correction:** The more I eat, the fatter I get.
> - **Why:** Parallel tenses sound better in this structure.
